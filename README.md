An abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more opponent points.

A game starts with an empty board. The main object of the game is to capture your opponent's points by surrounding them.

Players take turns, placing one of their points on a vacant place at each turn. Points are placed on the intersections of the grid lines and once played points are not moved.

However points may be captured, in which case they are no longer belong to any player, and kept by the capturing player as prisoners.
